# 💼 Workplace Mental Health: Cross-Country Analytics & Policy Recommendations

## 🔍 Overview
This project explores the state of workplace mental health across countries, with a focus on India. It combines global survey data with primary survey responses from Indian workplaces to assess the gap, quantify the economic impact, and develop an evidence-based policy model.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze and compare global vs Indian mental health trends at work.
- Identify systemic issues in access, stigma, and support.
- Quantify productivity losses and missed GDP due to workplace neglect.
- Propose a national policy framework using economic modeling (ICOR).
- Recommend interventions aligned with India's labor landscape.

## 🧠 Datasets Used
- `Global Survey`: Kaggle Mental Health in Tech dataset (~1200 entries)
- `India Survey`: Custom primary data from Indian workplaces (~70 entries)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
- **scikit-learn** for correlation and clustering
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization

---

## 📌 Highlights

### 🔹 Comparative Analytics
- Benchmarked India against countries like the US, UK, and Canada
- Compared metrics like employer support, stigma, help-seeking behavior

### 🔹 Economic Impact Estimation
- Modeled GDP and productivity loss using:
  - Absenteeism, presenteeism
  - Average output per worker
  - Sectoral employment share

### 🔹 Policy Simulation using ICOR
- Used ICOR to estimate output loss due to underinvestment
- Modeled benefits of plugging gaps in high-multiplier sectors (e.g., logistics, transit)

### 🔹 3-Step Mental Health Framework
- **Identify → Alert → Help** model
- Policy actions for:
  - **Government** (e.g., tax benefits, regulation)
  - **Companies** (e.g., training, EAPs)
  - **Individuals** (e.g., digital help tools)

## 📈 Key Takeaways
- India lags behind global peers in mental health policy at work.
- Ignoring workplace mental health results in measurable economic loss.
- A focused, data-backed policy investment can reverse productivity decline.
